# Diabetes-Prediction-ML-Project
This projects attempts to analyze a dataset containing medical and demographic information in order to build a machine learning model to predict if a person has diabetes based on a set of features. 

The 100,000 record dataset is containe in diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv and was collected from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset 

The Jupyter notebook FinalProjectVisualizationStrats.ipynb contains the visualizations of PCA and UMAP tested for this project.

The Jupyter notebook Diabetes_ML_model.ipynb contains the machine learning models and attempts to prove their performance.
